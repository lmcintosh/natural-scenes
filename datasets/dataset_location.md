The data is too large for my github account, so is located on the SNI-VCS server at
share/baccus/Lane/natural_scenes_datasets/2015_07_02_natural_scenes_stimulus_compressed.h5

For instructions on how to load the data, check the "Loading Natural Stimulus Tutorial" ipython notebook
in this repo's root directory.
